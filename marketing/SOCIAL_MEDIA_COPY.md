### **DAY 6: EDUCATIONAL THREAD**

**Platform:** Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1/4:**
```
Ever feel tired in a well-lit room? You might be experiencing 'bad light.'

Here's how light affects your vibe, and how Vibe Rated measures it. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2/4:**
```
Your brain works best between 300-500 lux for focused work.

Too dim (<100 lux) = eye strain  
Too bright (>1000 lux) = glare & headaches

We measure this for you.
```

**Tweet 3/4:**
```
Vibe Rated's light sensor gives you an instant lux reading, so you know if a space is optimized for work, relaxation, or creativity.

No more guessing.
```

**Tweet 4/4:**
```
Find your light. Find your frequency.

## 🎯 Viral Content Ideas

### **Idea 1: "The Vibe Experiment"**

**Concept:** Film yourself measuring the same location at different times of day. Show how the vibe score changes dramatically.

**Hook:** This café has 3 different vibes depending on when you go.

**Caption:**
```
Same place. Different times. Completely different vibes.

🌅 Morning: 88 (calm, focused)  
☀️ Afternoon: 62 (chaotic, loud)  
🌙 Evening: 91 (cozy, creative)

Timing is everything.

**Hook:** Starbucks vs. Local Café. Which has the better vibe?

**Caption:**

The results are in. 📊
